# SeaSense

#### A full React web app designed so users can check the ocean weather before they plan activities.

## Description
My family is extremely active in the ocean. My parents love to kayak and my brother is an avid surfer. They have an app that they bought in the App Store that they use to check the weather to see if it is safe for them to go out into the ocean to kayak or surf. I wanted to re-create this app for them and tailer it specifically to sports we do as a family. The goal of this app is to display different wind data points for various activities such as surfing, kayaking, sailing and snorkeling so users can see if it is safe for them to go out into the ocean.
